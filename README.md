# SimSyn

### What is SimSyn?

SimSyn is an icon-based tool for linking System Dynamics models developed in Vensim to datasets in PostgreSQL. It provides functionality for spanning large numbers of independent simulations over multidimensional data space. 

### Why using SimSyn?

There are a number System Dynamics programs providing database access (e.g. Vensim DSS, Stella or Powersim). However, these tools were not designed for large-scale subscripting operations. SimSyn provides the capabilities to read a database table line by line, run an independent simulation for parameters in every line and return multidimensional outputs to a new database table. Potential applications are comprehensive scenario or sensitivity runs, uncertainty analyses and spatial simulations.
