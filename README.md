# SimSyn

### What is SimSyn?

SimSyn is an icon-based tool for linking System Dynamics models developed in Vensim PLE to datasets in PostgreSQL. It provides functionality for spanning large numbers of independent simulations over multidimensional data space. 

### Why using SimSyn?

There are a number of System Dynamics programs providing database access (e.g. Vensim DSS, Stella or Powersim). However, these tools are typically not designed for large-scale subscripting operations. SimSyn provides the capabilities to run thousands of System Dynamics simulations in parallel, while having database read and write access. Potential applications are comprehensive scenario or sensitivity runs, uncertainty analyses and spatial simulations.
