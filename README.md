# 1. What is SimSyn?

SimSyn is an icon-based tool to link models developed in VENSIM to geographic and non-spatial database datasets in PostgreSQL. It provides powerful functionality for spanning large numbers of independent simulations over multidimensional data space or geographic space. Potential applications are comprehensive scenario or sensitivity runs, uncertainty analyses and spatial simulations.

# 2. Download and run SimSyn

Download the folder ‘SimSynEXE’ to an appropriate program file directory. Open the folder and unpack ‘scipy.linalg.cython_lapack’. Make sure the directory is /SimSynEXE/ scipy.linalg.cython_lapack.pyd. Start the application by clicking the executable file ‘SimSyn_v17.exe’ in the ‘SimSynEXE’ folder.
